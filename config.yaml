# sampling frequency for the input
sampling_frequency_msec: 1000

# inputs are those sampled by the Sequent Microsystem 16ch-optoinsulated board
# NOTE1: a simple wiring for alarm system sensors is to get their NC relay fed with positive voltage on
#        one side and then drive the other wire to the Sequent Microsystem input board; this means the
#        Sequent Microsystem input will normally be high... in other words it's an "active low" pin
# NOTE2: the inputs are numbered 1-based, just like in the silk-screen printing on the board itself
# NOTE3: the MQTT topic will be in the form "home/<input name>", don't use spaces in the name!
inputs:
  - name: opto_input_1
    input_num: 1
    active_low: true
  - name: opto_input_2
    input_num: 2
    active_low: true

# outputs channels are used to drive the SeenGreat 2ch optoinsulated board
# NOTE1: all outputs are active low in this kind of board (i.e. to trigger the relay the GPIO must be driven low)
# NOTE2: the MQTT topic will be in the form "home/<output name>", don't use spaces in the name!
outputs:
  - name: ext_alarm_siren
    gpio: 20
    active_low: true
  - name: int_alarm_siren
    gpio: 21
    active_low: true
